## MVC and JavaScript
MVC, which stands for Model-View-Controller, was the main focus of this week's assignment. After going over it in class, I implemented what we learned into a new website
I designed for this project. The website is organized with IDs which is visible from the URL. Everything else has been stylized in standard scss/css, written in HTML and
imported into the js code.
